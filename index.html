      <h1>New York State has the Lowest Rate of Veterans in the Country</h1>

        <p>The rates of veterans in the country greatly vary state by state. The national average is 8%, with Alaska having the highest rate and New York having the lowest rate at 12.2% and 4.6% respectively. </p>

        <div class="chart">
          <iframe title="New York and New Jersey have the lowest rates of veterans" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-7A3Nu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7A3Nu/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="499"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

          <h2>Factors Influencing Veteran Rates</h2>
          <p>There are numerous factors that influence veteran rates. One of these is location of military bases. Many of the states with high rates of veterans like Alaska and Virginia have a higher-than-average number of military bases and have multiple cities whose population relies on military jobs. </p>
            <p>Another factor that influences veteran rates is the rate of homelessness among veterans. According to the <a href= "https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/pit_count.asp">U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs</a href>, veterans make up 8% of the U.S. homeless population. States in the West and South that have milder weather like, Washington, Oregon, Florida, Texas and California have higher rates of homeless veterans. Some <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/working-paper/on-the-relationship-between-climate-and-homelessness/">studies</a href> have found that warmer areas generally tend to have higher rates of homelessness due to the impact of cold climates of homeless people. This could potentially cause a slight increase in veteran populations in these areas. </p>
              <p>One of the largest factors that may be influencing New York and New Jerseyâ€™s low rate of veterans is their foreign-born population. New York, New Jersey and California have the three highest rates of population born outside the U.S., and the three lowest rates of veterans. Currently only 3% of veterans in the U.S. were born outside the country, so states with higher immigrant populations would tend to have lower veteran populations.
